App Architecture
CareerLinkApp is built using Clean Architecture combined with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern and Repository Pattern to ensure:

Modularity: Easy to maintain and scale.
Testability: Simplified unit and UI testing.
Separation of Concerns: Clear distinction between UI, business logic, and data layers.

Multi-Module Structure
The app is organized into three independent modules:

UI Module (App Module):

Handles the presentation layer with Jetpack Compose for modern, reactive UI.
Contains ViewModels to manage UI-related data.


Data Module:

Manages data sources (Remote API, Room, DataStore, Firebase).
Implements repositories to abstract data access.


Domain Module:

Encapsulates business logic and use cases.
Promotes reusability and isolates complex logic from UI and data layers.




Tools and Techniques
Below is a comprehensive list of tools and technologies used in CareerLinkApp, along with a brief explanation of their role in the project:

KotlinModern programming language for Android development, offering concise syntax and safety features like null-safety.

Jetpack ComposeAndroid‚Äôs modern toolkit for building native, declarative UI, enabling faster and more flexible UI development.

Clean ArchitectureA design pattern that separates concerns into layers (Presentation, Domain, Data) for maintainable and testable code.

ModularizationDivides the codebase into independent modules (UI, Data, Domain) to reduce complexity and improve scalability.

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)An architecture pattern that separates UI (View) from business logic (ViewModel), improving code organization and testability.

Repository PatternAbstracts data sources (e.g., API, database) into a single interface, simplifying data access and management.

HiltA dependency injection library that simplifies providing dependencies (e.g., ViewModels, Repositories) across the app.

Room DatabaseA robust local database for caching job listings, enabling offline access to data.

DataStoreA lightweight solution for storing key-value pairs, used for user preferences like theme and language settings.

Firebase AuthenticationProvides secure user authentication with support for Email/Password and Google Sign-In.

Firebase FirestoreA cloud-based NoSQL database for storing user profiles and other app data.

RetrofitA type-safe HTTP client for making API requests to fetch job listings.

OkHttpA networking library that enhances HTTP performance and reliability for API calls.

Kotlin CoroutinesSimplifies asynchronous programming, used for tasks like API calls and database operations.

FlowA reactive stream for handling sequential data, used for real-time updates from the database or API.

StateFlowA state-holder for managing and observing UI state changes, integrated with ViewModels.

Navigation ComponentManages in-app navigation, ensuring smooth transitions between screens.

CoilA fast and lightweight image loading library for displaying job or user images.

TimberA logging library that simplifies debugging with enhanced log output.

SplashScreen APIProvides a modern, customizable splash screen for a polished app launch experience.
