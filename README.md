App Architecture
CareerLinkApp follows Clean Architecture with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern and Repository Pattern to ensure:

Separation of concerns.
Scalability and maintainability.
Easy testing and debugging.

The app is a multi-module project divided into three modules:

UI Module (App Module): Handles the presentation layer with Jetpack Compose for UI and ViewModels for data management.
Data Module: Contains business logic, data sources (Remote API, Room, DataStore, Firebase), and repositories.
Domain Module: Encapsulates complex business logic and use cases, ensuring reusability and modularity.

Tools and Techniques

Kotlin: Primary programming language.
Jetpack Compose: Modern toolkit for building native UI.
Clean Architecture: Promotes modular, maintainable, and testable code.
Modularization: Organizes the codebase into UI, Data, and Domain modules.
MVVM: Separates UI from business logic.
Repository Pattern: Isolates data layer from the app.
Hilt: Dependency injection for managing dependencies.
Room: Local database for caching job listings.
DataStore: Stores user preferences (e.g., theme, language).
Firebase:
Firebase Authentication: For user sign-up and login.
Firestore: For storing user profiles.


Retrofit: HTTP client for fetching job listings.
OkHttp: Efficient HTTP networking.
Kotlin Coroutines: For asynchronous programming.
Flow: For reactive data streams.
StateFlow: For state management.
Navigation Component: For in-app navigation.
Coil: For image loading.
Timber: For logging.
SplashScreen API: For modern splash screen support.
