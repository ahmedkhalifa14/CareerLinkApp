🏗️ App Architecture
CareerLinkApp is built with Clean Architecture, MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), and Repository Pattern to ensure:

Modularity: Easy to extend and maintain.  
Testability: Simplifies unit and UI testing.  
Separation of Concerns: Keeps UI, logic, and data layers independent.

🧩 Multi-Module Structure
The app is organized into three modules for flexibility and scalability:
1. UI Module (App Module)

Powers the Jetpack Compose UI and ViewModels.  
Handles user interactions and displays data dynamically.

2. Data Module

Manages data sources (API, Room, DataStore, Firebase).  
Provides repositories to abstract data access.

3. Domain Module

Encapsulates business logic and use cases.  
Promotes reusability and isolates complex logic.
